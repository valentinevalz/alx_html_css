# Alx HTML/CSS Advanced Project - Smile School Website

This project is a part of the ALX Front-end curriculum, focusing on advanced CSS styling to replicate a given design from Figma. The primary objective is to create a visually accurate and responsive web page by applying comprehensive CSS principles.

## Project Objectives

* **HTML Structure:** Utilize the provided HTML structure as a base, ensuring proper semantic tagging and correct image pathing.
* **CSS Styling:** Implement detailed CSS to precisely match the Figma design. This includes:
    * Setting up custom font families: 'Source Sans Pro' and 'Lora' (used 'Spin Cycle OT' was not found on Google Fonts, 'Lora' provides a similar bold, display-like feel).
    * Applying accurate color values, widths, heights, and margins/paddings as per the Figma specifications.
    * Creating responsive layouts using modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid) to ensure optimal viewing across various devices.
    * Styling individual sections: Header and Banner, Quotes, Videos List, Membership, FAQ, and Footer.
    * Incorporating SVG-based icons for social media and other elements where appropriate.
* **Code Quality:** Maintain clean, simple, and well-commented CSS with efficient and accurate selectors.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5: For structuring the web page content.
* CSS3: For styling and layout, including responsive design.
* Google Fonts: For importing 'Source Sans Pro' and 'Lora' font families.

## Design Reference

The design for this project is available on Figma. You can access it here:
* [Page in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rN6x3jP3lCgU0p1yXm7X3t/School-website)

**Important Font Note:**
If your computer doesnâ€™t have the fonts used, 'Source Sans Pro' and 'Lora' are linked via Google Fonts in `index.html`, ensuring they are loaded for all users. For the "Spin-Cycle-OT" font mentioned in the Figma notes, a similar serif font, 'Lora', has been used as a replacement for better web compatibility and availability through Google Fonts.

## Setup and Usage

To view this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the directory manually):**
    If using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/alx-html-css/css_advanced.git](https://github.com/alx-html-css/css_advanced.git) # Replace with your actual repo link if different
    cd css_advanced
    ```
    Otherwise, create a directory named `css_advanced`.

2.  **Download Images:**
    Download the project images from [https://intranet-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/files/1669469274291/images.zip](https://intranet-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/files/1669469274291/images.zip).
    Extract the contents of this zip file. You will need to organize these images into an `images/` subdirectory within your `css_advanced` folder, as specified in the "File Structure" below. Ensure the filenames match exactly (e.g., `Header and Banner.jpg`, `Bitmap.png`, `smile.svg`, etc.).

3.  **Place Files:**
    * Place the `index.html` file (provided below) directly inside the `css_advanced` directory.
    * Place the `styles.css` file (which will be provided in the next tasks) directly inside the `css_advanced` directory.
    * Create an `images/` folder inside `css_advanced` and place all downloaded image assets into it.

4.  **Open `index.html`:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The CSS will be linked automatically, and the images should display correctly if placed in the right `images` folder.

## File Structure

The expected directory and file structure is as follows:
